### ContentStyle
Having a container with content style `dashboard_menu` which has a child container with content style `menubar` will show a menu bar.
Buttons will be rendered as buttons that can be used to navigate.
Containers which contains buttons will render a button that will show a dropdown which contains these buttons.
Other elements can be shown as well but might not be styled.
