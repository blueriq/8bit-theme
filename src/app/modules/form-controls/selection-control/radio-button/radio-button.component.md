### Radio buttons

Radio buttons are rendered for attributes with a value list and the presentation style `radio`.

###### Direction
By default, radio buttons are presented below each other (vertical direction). Only if there are 2 radio buttons, they are presented next to each other (horizontal direction). You can override this behaviour using the presentation styles `horizontal` and `vertical`

###### Disabled & read only
When the attribute has a presentation style `Disabled` all the radio buttons are greyed out.

When the attribute has a read only flag, only the value of the attribute is presented (as text). If the attribute does not have a value, nothing is shown.
