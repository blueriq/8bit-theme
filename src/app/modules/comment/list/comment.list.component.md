### Commentlist
This renders the `AQ_Dashboard_Commentlist` container displaying a container for each comment entry.

#### Displaying comment dates
When more than 7 days have passed since the comment was posted, a full date including the time will be shown, like `12 juli 2019 13:37`.

When the comment was posted less then 7 days ago, instead of the date the number of days/minutes/seconds that have been passed will be shown, like `A few seconds ago`.
