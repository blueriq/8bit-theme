This component create a game when the following has been done:

## Make it work
1. Put the presentation style 'Game' on a container
2. Put a Text Field within this container, this will handle the players name of the game (This will be shown when game over)
3. Put a Number Field within this container, this will handle the score of the game (This won't be visible)
4. Put a Button within this container, this button will handle a continue event

Note: Name or presentation styles of the fields and button are not relevant, only its type must match

## Playfield:
Put anything on a page as long it's outside the 'Game' container but on the same page.
Buttons and text-fields are collidable objects.
