### Read only
The read only component shows the question text and input in a non-editable style. For the components
with `dataType=boolean` the read only component will not be triggered. Because the look and feel for
the select and checkbox will be the same as disabled.

The priorityOffset is 1000, because in this way has the read only component the highest priority in case 
of the other components.
